        <h3>Chirstmas is comming!</h3>
        <p>Christmas is a time for joy, celebration, and of course, delicious food. As the temperatures outside begin to drop and 
            the days get shorter, there is nothing better than spending time in the kitchen, cooking up warm, comforting dishes 
            to enjoy with friends and family.

            One of the most iconic dishes associated with Christmas is roast turkey, which is often the centerpiece of the 
            Christmas meal. This classic dish is typically made by roasting a whole turkey in the oven, basting it with butter 
            or oil to keep it moist, and serving it with a variety of tasty side dishes like stuffing, gravy, and cranberry sauce.
            
            Another popular Christmas dish is ham, which is often glazed with a sweet and tangy sauce made from honey, brown 
            sugar, and pineapple. This dish is perfect for feeding a crowd and can be sliced and served with a variety of 
            different side dishes, such as roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, and green beans.
            
            In addition to these classic dishes, many people also enjoy making sweet treats like Christmas cookies, fruitcake, 
            and candies to share with their loved ones. These desserts are often decorated with festive colors and designs, making them a fun and enjoyable part of the holiday season.
            <p>The joy of cooking during the Christmas season goes beyond just the delicious dishes that are created. It is also 
            about spending time with loved ones, creating traditions, and making memories that will last a lifetime. For many people, the act of cooking and preparing a meal is a form of self-care and relaxation, allowing them to take a break from the busyness of everyday life and focus on the present moment.
            
            Additionally, the Christmas season is a great time to try out new recipes and expand your culinary skills. There are
            countless recipes available online or in cookbooks that can provide inspiration and help you create unique and delicious dishes to share with your loved ones.
            So why not gather your friends and family and get cooking this Christmas season? Whether you are a seasoned chef or just starting out in the kitchen, there is
             something for everyone to enjoy during the holidays. And who knows, you may even discover a new passion for cooking along the way!
